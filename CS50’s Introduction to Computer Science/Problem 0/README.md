Problem 0 is a assignment to implement in Scratch at scratch.mit.edu. following requirements:<br>
  &nbsp;Your project must use at least two sprites, at least one of which must not be a cat.<br>
  &nbsp;Your project must have at least three scripts total (i.e., not necessarily three per sprite).<br>
  &nbsp;Your project must use at least one conditional, at least one loop, and at least one variable.<br>
  &nbsp;Your project must use at least one custom block that you have made yourself (via Make a Block), which must take at least one input.<br>
  &nbsp;Your project should be more complex than most of those demonstrated in lecture (many of which, though instructive, were quite short)<br>
  &nbsp; but it can be less complex than Oscartime and Ivyâ€™s Hardest Game.<br>
  
My project is a simple calculation question generator to randomly generate addition and substitution questions from 0 to 100.
